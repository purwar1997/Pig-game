# Pig Game

A game to understand how DOM manipulation works.

This game can be played by two players only. Each player will be assigned two scores: Current score and Total score. Each time a dice is rolled, player's current score will get updated but total score will only get updated when he presses the hold button. If number 1 shows up on rolling dice, then current score will be rendered zero and total score won't get updated.

Player will get changed if

1.  He presses the hold button
2.  Number 1 shows up on dice.

Player who first reaches the total score of 100 will be the winner.
